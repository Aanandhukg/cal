        <h2>Usage</h2>
        <p>If you need to perform some basic calculations, such as adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing, a calculator is probably your best bet. These types of calculations can be done with pen and paper, but a calculator makes it much easier and faster. In a matter of moments you'll have a reliable answer. Besides being accurate and fast, calculators are also very easy to use.</p>

        <h2><span>ADD</span></h2>
        <p>If you want to add several numbers all you have to do is key in the first number then hit the Add (+) key, key in the next number and hit the Add key again. After you enter the final number hit the Add key or the Equals (=) key and you will have your total. Note that you receive a subtotal after every number keyed in when you hit the Add key. Want to find the average of the numbers you've just added together? After adding the numbers, press the Divide by (/) key and then input the number of numbers you keyed in (i.e., if you added five numbers together, enter "5") and then press the Equals key.</p>

        <h2><span>SUBTRACT</span></h2>
        <p>The calculator can subtract numbers just as easily. Key in a number, such as 789, and then hit the Subtract (-) key. Enter another number, such as 456, and then press the Subtract key once again, or the Equals key, and you'll have your answer, in this case 333.</p>

If you want to multiply more numbers, simply enter another number and press the multiply key again.</p>
